Download elastic search, kibana and logstash

Follow the below steps to initialize and run the tools:

*********************** How to install & start Elastic-search? ***********************
Download the latest windows zip file from https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch
Extract the zip file at C:\elastic-stack\
Add below properties inside /config/elasticsearch.yml
	xpack.security.enabled: true
	xpack.security.enrollment.enabled: true
Delete the 'elasticsearch' directory if exists from C:\Users\%USER_ID%\AppData\Local\Temp. This step is run only once i.e. during installation time only.
cd C:\elastic-stack\elasticsearch-8.8.0\bin
Run "elasticsearch.bat"
Wait for few mins so that Elastic search service will be started properly. It will display the generated password for the user 'elastic'. Copy that password & save it in your backup file.
Now, run "localhost:9200" inside browser.
Enter username & password as (elastic/generated_password). You should get elastic service details in JSON format inside browser. It completes the Elastic Search installation.

 

 

*********************** How to install & start Kibana? ***********************
Download the latest windows zip file from https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana
Extract the zip file at C:\elastic-stack\
Edit kibana.yml & uncomment below properties:
server.port: 5601
elasticsearch.hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"]
In order to access Elasticsearch from Kibana, we need to generate service token using elasticsearch service with below command executed on elastic search bin directory.
elasticsearch-service-tokens create elastic/kibana my-token
Copy the newly generated token & add it inside kibana.yml as shown below:
elasticsearch.serviceAccountToken: "paste_generated_token_here"
Start the Kibana service using kibana.bat file. You need to wait for 3/4 minutes to start the Kibana service first time.
Now, you can hit localhost:5601 & login with the user 'elastic'. If the login is successful, it means Kibana is installed properly.

 

 

*********************** How to install & start Logstash? ***********************
Download the latest windows zip file from https://www.elastic.co/downloads/logstash
Extract the zip file at C:\elastic-stack\
Create a new file config\logstash-sample.conf with below contents.
input {
  stdin {
  }
}
output {

 

  stdout {
    codec => rubydebug
  }

 

  elasticsearch {
    hosts => ["http://localhost:9200"]
    index => "bankapp"
    user => "elastic"
    password => "your_password"
  }
}
Start the logstash with the command: 'logstash -f ./config/logstash-sample.conf --config.reload.automatic'. You need to wait for few minutes to start the logstash properly.

To reset the password :-  PS D:\Elastic\elasticsearch-8.10.0-windows-x86_64\elasticsearch-8.10.0\bin> .\elasticsearch-reset-password -u elastic .
